Gaishi- earth beings, spirits, mysterious creatures with a strong bond to nature... troublemakers, sometimes harmless, sometimes extremely dangerous, and these ancient spirits come in many different forms. Many unsolved mysteries are said to be linked with these creatures. However, they are widely unknown. There are only a few specialists regarding these creatures, most of them are called "shamans" "druids", but the correct term is ishiki, taking the role of both scientists, healers, and warriors. These "ishiki" not only study the Gaishi, but also heal people afflicted by them, or drive them from the lands (or the minds...) with their own special powers. They are also said to be able to manipulate the mysterious powers of the Gaishi as their own. There are even legends of some ishiki actually being Gaishi only in human form, but lets not get too absurd... right?

We follow an ishiki named Calyx, but he's more commonly known simply as cal.
